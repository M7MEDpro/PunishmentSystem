## ⚡ Performance & Architecture

### Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Mute Check Time** | <1ms | Time to verify if player is muted |
| **Memory Usage** | ~50MB | Total plugin memory footprint |
| **Database Latency** | Async | No main thread blocking |

## 🧠 Smart Caching System

### Why Only Cache Active Mutes?

PunishmentSystem uses an intelligent selective caching strategy that **only caches active mutes** rather than all punishments. Here's why this approach is optimal:

#### 🎯 **Frequency-Based Optimization**
```
Chat Event Frequency: Every few seconds per player
Ban Check Frequency: Only at login (once per session)
Mute Check Frequency: Every chat message (thousands per minute)
```

#### 💾 **Memory Efficiency Comparison**

<table>
<tr>
<th>Caching Strategy</th>
<th>Memory Usage</th>
<th>Performance</th>
<th>Efficiency</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>All Punishments</strong></td>
<td>~500MB</td>
<td>Fast</td>
<td>❌ Wasteful</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Active Mutes Only</strong></td>
<td>~50MB</td>
<td>Fast</td>
<td>✅ Optimal</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>No Caching</strong></td>
<td>~10MB</td>
<td>Slow</td>
<td>❌ Poor UX</td>
</tr>
</table>

#### 🔍 **Technical Reasoning**

1. **Chat Performance Critical**
  - Mute checks happen on **every chat message**
  - Sub-millisecond response time required
  - Cache miss would cause chat lag

2. **Ban Checks Are Infrequent**
  - Only checked during **player login**
  - Acceptable to query database (happens once)
  - No performance impact on gameplay

3. **Memory vs Performance Balance**
   ```java
   // Typical server statistics:
   Total Punishments: 100,000+
   Active Mutes: ~50-200
   Memory Saved: 90%+ reduction
   Performance: No degradation
   ```

#### ⚙️ **Cache Management**

```yaml
cache:
  enabled: true
  update-interval: 5    # Seconds between cache updates
  mute-only: true      # Only cache active mutes
  auto-cleanup: true   # Remove expired entries
  max-size: 10000     # Maximum cached entries
```

#### 🔄 **Cache Lifecycle**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Player Muted] --> B[Add to Cache]
    B --> C[Chat Messages]
    C --> D[Cache Hit <1ms]
    D --> C

## 🗄️ Database Configuration

### SQLite (Default)
**Perfect for single servers**

```yaml
database:
  type: SQLITE
  sqlite:
    file: plugins/PunishmentSystem/data.db
    auto-backup: true
    backup-interval: 24h
```

**Pros:** No setup required, automatic maintenance  
**Cons:** Single server only, limited scalability

### MySQL (Recommended)
**Ideal for networks and high-traffic servers**

```yaml
database:
  type: MYSQL
  mysql:
    host: localhost
    port: 3306
    database: punishments
    username: punishment_user
    password: secure_password
    # Connection pool settings
    pool-size: 10
    connection-timeout: 30000
    # SSL settings
    use-ssl: true
    verify-certificates: false
```

**Pros:** Network support, high performance, scalable  
**Cons:** Requires setup and maintenance

### MongoDB (Advanced)
**NoSQL option for complex setups**

```yaml
database:
  type: MONGO
  mongo:
    uri: mongodb://username:password@localhost:27017
    database: punishments
    collection: punishments
    # Connection options
    connection-timeout: 30000
    read-preference: PRIMARY
```

**Pros:** Flexible schema, advanced querying  
**Cons:** More complex setup, requires MongoDB knowledge

## 📝 Usage Examples

### Basic Punishment Examples

```bash
# Permanent punishments
/ban GrieferPlayer Destroyed spawn area
/mute SpammerPlayer Excessive spam in chat
/ipban HackerPlayer Using VPN to evade ban

# Temporary punishments
/tban NewPlayer 1d First offense - breaking rules
/tmute CapsPlayer 30m Using excessive caps

```

### Punishment Escalation Examples

```bash
# Progressive punishment system
# First offense
/tmute FirstTimer 10m "First warning - please read /rules"

# Second offense  
/tmute FirstTimer 1h "Second offense - temp mute increased"

# Third offense
/tmute FirstTimer 24h "Third offense - 24h mute for repeated violations"

# Final step
/ban FirstTimer "Continued rule violations after multiple warnings"

## 🛡️ Best Practices

### 📋 Server Administration

<details>
<summary><strong>Punishment Guidelines</strong></summary>

- **Clear Reasons**: Always provide specific, detailed reasons
  ```bash
  ❌ /ban Player123 bad
  ✅ /ban Player123 Griefing spawn area - destroyed fountain and pathways
  ```

- **Progressive Punishment**: Escalate punishments appropriately
  ```bash
  1st offense: Warning or short mute
  2nd offense: Longer mute or short ban
  3rd offense: Extended ban
  Severe offense: Immediate permanent ban
  ```

- **Documentation**: Keep detailed records
  ```bash
  /history PlayerName  # Always check before punishing
  ```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Performance Optimization</strong></summary>

- **Database Choice**: Use MySQL for networks, SQLite for single servers
- **Cache Settings**: Enable mute caching for busy servers
- **Regular Maintenance**: Clean old punishments periodically
- **Monitor Resources**: Watch memory usage and performance

```yaml
# Optimal settings for busy servers
cache:
  enabled: true
  mute-only: true
  update-interval: 3

performance:
  thread-pool-size: 5
  async-operations: true
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Security Measures</strong></summary>

- **Permission Management**: Use fine-grained permissions
- **Database Security**: Strong passwords and SSL connections
- **Regular Backups**: Automated backup system
- **Audit Logging**: Monitor staff punishment activity

```yaml
# Security-focused configuration
database:
  mysql:
    use-ssl: true
    verify-certificates: true
    
notifications:
  log-to-file: true
  staff-notifications: true
```

</details>

### 👥 Staff Training

#### Essential Commands for Staff
```bash
# Before punishing - always check history
/history <player>

# Appropriate punishment escalation
/tmute <player> 10m First warning - spam
/tmute <player> 1h Second offense - continued spam  
/tban <player> 1d Third offense - ignoring staff

# Immediate severe punishments
/ban <player> Hacking - flying and speed hacks
/ipban <player> Ban evasion using alt account
```

#### Common Mistake Prevention
- ✅ Always check `/history` before punishing
- ✅ Use specific, detailed reasons
- ✅ Follow server's punishment guidelines
- ✅ Communicate with other staff members
- ❌ Don't use vague reasons like "being bad"
- ❌ Don't skip punishment escalation steps
- ❌ Don't forget to document evidence
